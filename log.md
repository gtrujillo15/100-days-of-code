#100 Days of Code - Gaby's Log

**Thoughts on 100 Days of Code** My goal through completing 100 days of code is to be able to document my journey in learning HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc. and be able to see how far I've come at the end of the challenge. I'm excited to learn and I think this challenge will help give me a boost in making sure I'm always putting time in towards my education. One of my big goals for 2019 is to have a career in Computer Science so I hope this challenge will help in my long journey.

### Day 1: Wednesday, February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I purchased a JavaScript for Beginners course on Udemy through Traversy Media and completed one hour of the class.

**Thoughts** I was recommended by some fellow peers at Bitwise to purcahse a Udemy course, if interested, to help supplement my learning through the Intro to JavaScript class. I really enjoyed the course so far. I remember my Intro to JS teacher recommended that even through I've used Atom in the past as my editor, to also look into VS Code and I ended up dowwnloading it along with some extensions and I really like it. Of course, the first hour of the Traversy Udemy course was really simple in getting VS Code downloaded and then we went through using the console, variables, a little bit on objects.

Just to make a note, I really enjoy logging my thoughts so these portions will be long. I did want to spend a bit of time working on a personal project of the ToDoApp repo but I want to make sure I get a good nights sleep for my day job and JS class tomorrow so I will be doing some light yoga and heading to bed. However, I will be in class tomorrow and Friday will hopefully be spent studying with friends, if not, head to Bitwise to go to Study Group.

### Day 2: Thursday, February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went to JS class and we continued on creating the chat. It was cool to see how the project formed and items kept getting added on to make the chat even better and we got to send each other notes through the chat. I learned about Node.JS and over the weekend I'm going to look more into the server and how it works.

**Thoughts**: Super cool to see how the chat improved with only a few more lines of code added. I definitely feel I'm getting to understand certain concepts and the patterns that are created (functions, arrays). I just need to make sure I'm practicing them on my own time.

## Day 3: Friday, February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent my time researching issues I've been having with git and some of my repo's. I don't feel I made any progress as I spent the majority of the time trying to figure out issues to be able to work on some projects but wasn't able to understand answers.

**Thoughts** I spent the last 30 minutes frustrated because I wanted to rename my portfolio repo to mfw-portfolio and am able to easily do it on Github but cannot seem to change it on my locally. I can't just rename the folder becauase then my terminal won't recognize it and I tried doing it from there but it's not working. I really want to work on creating a new portfolio but it will have such a different design from the one I created on MFW that I think it would be better to keep the work from the old version instead of tearing it down to create the new one. I could always just create a new repo titled "newportfolio" and then change it later when I get help but I really wanted to see if I could change the files locally myself. I am also just really tired so it took longer to research through. Most likely, I'll create the new repo first and rename everything later. It has been awhile since I've made contributions so I really want to get something new started.

## 3 DAY WEEEKEND: MUST DO'S
1. Work on ToDoApp project. 
2. Look into JS chat/node.js and server
3. Studing on udemy - DONE, SUN
4. Create new portfolio repo and work on it
5. Would like to go to Sunday's study group - DID NOT GO

## Day 4: Sunday, February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent over an hour going through the Udemy class and refreshed on the basics. Arrays, strings, booleans, numbers, Math, splicing arrays, etc. I also created the wireframe for my new portfolio. Am hoping I can create the repo and boilerplate at least before calling it a day. I also need to spend at least 10 minutes on PHP.

**Thoughts** It was nice to go over the basics again and go into detail about all the small things you can do with JS. I know I need to  spend at least 10 minutes each day with PHP too since I have a small contract starting soon to create a WP website. Definitely not as frustrating as Friday so it feels good to feel like I got somewhere today. I took Saturday off to celebrate Valentine's Day with my fiance.

## Day 5: Monday, February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed on the index page for my portfolio (just need to add social media for now) and the About Me page. I worked on the My Work page. Downloaded JS server.

**Thoughts** I loved working on my portfolio today and I spent the majority of the day working on it. I absolutely loved creating it and even the semi-frustrating parts of getting the box outlines (columns, rows) set up was fun because I knew I would get it and I did. I grabbed the colors I wanted, I got my index page to look just like my wireframe as well as my About Me page. I didn't spend much time on anything else because I became too engrossed in my portfolio. I did look a bit into the code we have for the group project in class, made sure I could get server working, and looked over a bit at some JavaScript but I was too excited to get back to my project. I'm too happy with how it's turning out so I already published it. I don't mind doing it now since I won't be formally posting it anywhere until later, but for now just show friends/family. My portfolio is a design that I love. I think I may fidget with the colors a bit, but I love how it is right now.

## Day 6: Tuesday, February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This day I went to class and we practiced JS by creating a mock Flappy Bird app. I got to learn about how an app can be built through JS, like the simple math (length, width, height) it takes to move the pictures to create an effect. 

**Thoughts** It was a lot of fun to take an app that quite a few us enjoyed and try to recreate it. I would say it was one of the funnest projects we worked on during the class. I was sad though because this would have been the last "normal" class we had as Thursday was presentation day. We also learned we had a presentation we needed to create by Thursday if we could. I wasn't sure if there was a final project but I knew that we had built plenty of projects in class that I could take one and recreate and add additional features to make into my own.

## Day 7: Wednesday, Friday 20, 2019

**Today's Progress** I created a To Do List!

**Thoughts** I took one of the projects we had created earlier in our class which was a To Do List and added some features, such as a "Completed" section, and am planning to add an EventListener to it to make sure I can move items to the completed list. I still have some work to do on it but I'm glad with what I've done so far. I stayed up late, until 12:30pm ish putting it together. It was nice working at night with the rain and lo fi music.

## Day 8: Thursday, February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Presented my To Do page as my final project for the class and completed the class, having attended all classes. FYI, I have also signed up for the no-instructor JavaScript class.

**Thoughts** Technically, I didn't actually work on any projects or do much coding (I still had my day job to do) but I presented my To Do List page in front of my class and students from another class. It was definitely nerve wracking but I had plenty of people cheering me on so I felt like I had lots of support and positive vibes. I felt proud with what I have learned so far and while I'm still definitely lost on JavaScript, it is definitely a language I will continue to learn and hearing plenty of people who also felt the same and that it takes time to grow used to and get confident in, I feel like I'm in good company. I'm sad to see the class finish but I'm looking forward to the future and will continue to keep the friendships and connections I made in class with me. 

## Day 9: Saturday, February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I added a WuFoo form to my contact page and I added my projects to my My Work page. I also added a scrollbar to the My Work page because I wanted to keep the short div look, if that makes sense.

**Thoughts** I took Friday off because for some reason, my day job was incredibly hectic and creating my final project in a night was also quite a bit to take on. So after I got out of work on Friday--which was luckily a quiet day--I watched tv, had a beer, and relaxed as a celebration. I came back to working on my projects today and continuied with my new portfolio page. I added my recent projects to the My Work page. I still need to add my Websites for Beginners repo's into there as well but I have to link it to Github first. I also added a scrollbar so I can keep the short page look. Lastly, I added a WuFoo form to my contact page for now. In the future, I'd like to add my own contact form for the practice and to have my own design on it but for now, this works.
