#100 Days of Code - Gaby's Log

**Thoughts on 100 Days of Code** My goal through completing 100 days of code is to be able to document my journey in learning HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc. and be able to see how far I've come at the end of the challenge. I'm excited to learn and I think this challenge will help give me a boost in making sure I'm always putting time in towards my education. One of my big goals for 2019 is to have a career in Computer Science so I hope this challenge will help in my long journey.

### Day 1: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I purchased a JavaScript for Beginners course on Udemy through Traversy Media and completed one hour of the class.

**Thoughts** I was recommended by some fellow peers at Bitwise to purcahse a Udemy course, if interested, to help supplement my learning through the Intro to JavaScript class. I really enjoyed the course so far. I remember my Intro to JS teacher recommended that even through I've used Atom in the past as my editor, to also look into VS Code and I ended up dowwnloading it along with some extensions and I really like it. Of course, the first hour of the Traversy Udemy course was really simple in getting VS Code downloaded and then we went through using the console, variables, a little bit on objects.

Just to make a note, I really enjoy logging my thoughts so these portions will be long. I did want to spend a bit of time working on a personal project of the ToDoApp repo but I want to make sure I get a good nights sleep for my day job and JS class tomorrow so I will be doing some light yoga and heading to bed. However, I will be in class tomorrow and Friday will hopefully be spent studying with friends, if not, head to Bitwise to go to Study Group.
