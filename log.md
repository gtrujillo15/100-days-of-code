#100 Days of Code - Gaby's Log

**Thoughts on 100 Days of Code** My goal through completing 100 days of code is to be able to document my journey in learning HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc. and be able to see how far I've come at the end of the challenge. I'm excited to learn and I think this challenge will help give me a boost in making sure I'm always putting time in towards my education. One of my big goals for 2019 is to have a career in Computer Science so I hope this challenge will help in my long journey.

### Day 1: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I purchased a JavaScript for Beginners course on Udemy through Traversy Media and completed one hour of the class.

**Thoughts** I was recommended by some fellow peers at Bitwise to purcahse a Udemy course, if interested, to help supplement my learning through the Intro to JavaScript class. I really enjoyed the course so far. I remember my Intro to JS teacher recommended that even through I've used Atom in the past as my editor, to also look into VS Code and I ended up dowwnloading it along with some extensions and I really like it. Of course, the first hour of the Traversy Udemy course was really simple in getting VS Code downloaded and then we went through using the console, variables, a little bit on objects.

Just to make a note, I really enjoy logging my thoughts so these portions will be long. I did want to spend a bit of time working on a personal project of the ToDoApp repo but I want to make sure I get a good nights sleep for my day job and JS class tomorrow so I will be doing some light yoga and heading to bed. However, I will be in class tomorrow and Friday will hopefully be spent studying with friends, if not, head to Bitwise to go to Study Group.

### Day 2: Thursday, February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went to JS class and we continued on creating the chat. It was cool to see how the project formed and items kept getting added on to make the chat even better and we got to send each other notes through the chat. I learned about Node.JS and over the weekend I'm going to look more into the server and how it works.

**Thoughts**: Super cool to see how the chat improved with only a few more lines of code added. I definitely feel I'm getting to understand certain concepts and the patterns that are created (functions, arrays). I just need to make sure I'm practicing them on my own time.

## Day 3: Friday, February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent my time researching issues I've been having with git and some of my repo's. I don't feel I made any progress as I spent the majority of the time trying to figure out issues to be able to work on some projects but wasn't able to understand answers.

**Thoughts** I spent the last 30 minutes frustrated because I wanted to rename my portfolio repo to mfw-portfolio and am able to easily do it on Github but cannot seem to change it on my locally. I can't just rename the folder becauase then my terminal won't recognize it and I tried doing it from there but it's not working. I really want to work on creating a new portfolio but it will have such a different design from the one I created on MFW that I think it would be better to keep the work from the old version instead of tearing it down to create the new one. I could always just create a new repo titled "newportfolio" and then change it later when I get help but I really wanted to see if I could change the files locally myself. I am also just really tired so it took longer to research through. Most likely, I'll create the new repo first and rename everything later. It has been awhile since I've made contributions so I really want to get something new started.

## 3 DAY WEEEKEND: MUST DO'S
1. Work on ToDoApp project. 
2. Look into JS chat/node.js and server
3. Studing on udemy - DONE, SUN
4. Create new portfolio repo and work on it
5. Would like to go to Sunday's study group - DID NOT GO

## Day 4: Sunday, February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent over an hour going through the Udemy class and refreshed on the basics. Arrays, strings, booleans, numbers, Math, splicing arrays, etc. I also created the wireframe for my new portfolio. Am hoping I can create the repo and boilerplate at least before calling it a day. I also need to spend at least 10 minutes on PHP.

**Thoughts** It was nice to go over the basics again and go into detail about all the small things you can do with JS. I know I need to  spend at least 10 minutes each day with PHP too since I have a small contract starting soon to create a WP website. Definitely not as frustrating as Friday so it feels good to feel like I got somewhere today. I took Saturday off to celebrate Valentine's Day with my fiance.

## Day 5: Monday, February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed on the index page for my portfolio (just need to add social media for now) and the About Me page. I worked on the My Work page. Downloaded JS server.

**Thoughts** I loved working on my portfolio today and I spent the majority of the day working on it. I absolutely loved creating it and even the semi-frustrating parts of getting the box outlines (columns, rows) set up was fun because I knew I would get it and I did. I grabbed the colors I wanted, I got my index page to look just like my wireframe as well as my About Me page. I didn't spend much time on anything else because I became too engrossed in my portfolio. I did look a bit into the code we have for the group project in class, made sure I could get server working, and looked over a bit at some JavaScript but I was too excited to get back to my project. I'm too happy with how it's turning out so I already published it. I don't mind doing it now since I won't be formally posting it anywhere until later, but for now just show friends/family. My portfolio is a design that I love. I think I may fidget with the colors a bit, but I love how it is right now.
