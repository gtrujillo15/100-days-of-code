#100 Days of Code - Gaby's Log

**Thoughts on 100 Days of Code** My goal through completing 100 days of code is to be able to document my journey in learning HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc. and be able to see how far I've come at the end of the challenge. I'm excited to learn and I think this challenge will help give me a boost in making sure I'm always putting time in towards my education. One of my big goals for 2019 is to have a career in Computer Science so I hope this challenge will help in my long journey.

### Day 1: Wednesday, February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I purchased a JavaScript for Beginners course on Udemy through Traversy Media and completed one hour of the class.

**Thoughts** I was recommended by some fellow peers at Bitwise to purcahse a Udemy course, if interested, to help supplement my learning through the Intro to JavaScript class. I really enjoyed the course so far. I remember my Intro to JS teacher recommended that even through I've used Atom in the past as my editor, to also look into VS Code and I ended up dowwnloading it along with some extensions and I really like it. Of course, the first hour of the Traversy Udemy course was really simple in getting VS Code downloaded and then we went through using the console, variables, a little bit on objects.

Just to make a note, I really enjoy logging my thoughts so these portions will be long. I did want to spend a bit of time working on a personal project of the ToDoApp repo but I want to make sure I get a good nights sleep for my day job and JS class tomorrow so I will be doing some light yoga and heading to bed. However, I will be in class tomorrow and Friday will hopefully be spent studying with friends, if not, head to Bitwise to go to Study Group.

### Day 2: Thursday, February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went to JS class and we continued on creating the chat. It was cool to see how the project formed and items kept getting added on to make the chat even better and we got to send each other notes through the chat. I learned about Node.JS and over the weekend I'm going to look more into the server and how it works.

**Thoughts**: Super cool to see how the chat improved with only a few more lines of code added. I definitely feel I'm getting to understand certain concepts and the patterns that are created (functions, arrays). I just need to make sure I'm practicing them on my own time.

## Day 3: Friday, February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent my time researching issues I've been having with git and some of my repo's. I don't feel I made any progress as I spent the majority of the time trying to figure out issues to be able to work on some projects but wasn't able to understand answers.

**Thoughts** I spent the last 30 minutes frustrated because I wanted to rename my portfolio repo to mfw-portfolio and am able to easily do it on Github but cannot seem to change it on my locally. I can't just rename the folder becauase then my terminal won't recognize it and I tried doing it from there but it's not working. I really want to work on creating a new portfolio but it will have such a different design from the one I created on MFW that I think it would be better to keep the work from the old version instead of tearing it down to create the new one. I could always just create a new repo titled "newportfolio" and then change it later when I get help but I really wanted to see if I could change the files locally myself. I am also just really tired so it took longer to research through. Most likely, I'll create the new repo first and rename everything later. It has been awhile since I've made contributions so I really want to get something new started.

## 3 DAY WEEEKEND: MUST DO'S
1. Work on ToDoApp project. 
2. Look into JS chat/node.js and server
3. Studing on udemy - DONE, SUN
4. Create new portfolio repo and work on it
5. Would like to go to Sunday's study group - DID NOT GO

## Day 4: Sunday, February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent over an hour going through the Udemy class and refreshed on the basics. Arrays, strings, booleans, numbers, Math, splicing arrays, etc. I also created the wireframe for my new portfolio. Am hoping I can create the repo and boilerplate at least before calling it a day. I also need to spend at least 10 minutes on PHP.

**Thoughts** It was nice to go over the basics again and go into detail about all the small things you can do with JS. I know I need to  spend at least 10 minutes each day with PHP too since I have a small contract starting soon to create a WP website. Definitely not as frustrating as Friday so it feels good to feel like I got somewhere today. I took Saturday off to celebrate Valentine's Day with my fiance.

## Day 5: Monday, February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed on the index page for my portfolio (just need to add social media for now) and the About Me page. I worked on the My Work page. Downloaded JS server.

**Thoughts** I loved working on my portfolio today and I spent the majority of the day working on it. I absolutely loved creating it and even the semi-frustrating parts of getting the box outlines (columns, rows) set up was fun because I knew I would get it and I did. I grabbed the colors I wanted, I got my index page to look just like my wireframe as well as my About Me page. I didn't spend much time on anything else because I became too engrossed in my portfolio. I did look a bit into the code we have for the group project in class, made sure I could get server working, and looked over a bit at some JavaScript but I was too excited to get back to my project. I'm too happy with how it's turning out so I already published it. I don't mind doing it now since I won't be formally posting it anywhere until later, but for now just show friends/family. My portfolio is a design that I love. I think I may fidget with the colors a bit, but I love how it is right now.

## Day 6: Tuesday, February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This day I went to class and we practiced JS by creating a mock Flappy Bird app. I got to learn about how an app can be built through JS, like the simple math (length, width, height) it takes to move the pictures to create an effect. 

**Thoughts** It was a lot of fun to take an app that quite a few us enjoyed and try to recreate it. I would say it was one of the funnest projects we worked on during the class. I was sad though because this would have been the last "normal" class we had as Thursday was presentation day. We also learned we had a presentation we needed to create by Thursday if we could. I wasn't sure if there was a final project but I knew that we had built plenty of projects in class that I could take one and recreate and add additional features to make into my own.

**Link to Work** No Links at this time

## Day 7: Wednesday, Friday 20, 2019

**Today's Progress** I created a To Do List!

**Thoughts** I took one of the projects we had created earlier in our class which was a To Do List and added some features, such as a "Completed" section, and am planning to add an EventListener to it to make sure I can move items to the completed list. I still have some work to do on it but I'm glad with what I've done so far. I stayed up late, until 12:30pm ish putting it together. It was nice working at night with the rain and lo fi music.

**Link to Work** [ToDoApp](https://gtrujillo15.github.io/TodoApp/)

## Day 8: Thursday, February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Presented my To Do page as my final project for the class and completed the class, having attended all classes. FYI, I have also signed up for the no-instructor JavaScript class.

**Thoughts** Technically, I didn't actually work on any projects or do much coding (I still had my day job to do) but I presented my To Do List page in front of my class and students from another class. It was definitely nerve wracking but I had plenty of people cheering me on so I felt like I had lots of support and positive vibes. I felt proud with what I have learned so far and while I'm still definitely lost on JavaScript, it is definitely a language I will continue to learn and hearing plenty of people who also felt the same and that it takes time to grow used to and get confident in, I feel like I'm in good company. I'm sad to see the class finish but I'm looking forward to the future and will continue to keep the friendships and connections I made in class with me. 

## Day 9: Saturday, February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I added a WuFoo form to my contact page and I added my projects to my My Work page. I also added a scrollbar to the My Work page because I wanted to keep the short div look, if that makes sense.

**Thoughts** I took Friday off because for some reason, my day job was incredibly hectic and creating my final project in a night was also quite a bit to take on. So after I got out of work on Friday--which was luckily a quiet day--I watched tv, had a beer, and relaxed as a celebration. I came back to working on my projects today and continuied with my new portfolio page. I added my recent projects to the My Work page. I still need to add my Websites for Beginners repo's into there as well but I have to link it to Github first. I also added a scrollbar so I can keep the short page look. Lastly, I added a WuFoo form to my contact page for now. In the future, I'd like to add my own contact form for the practice and to have my own design on it but for now, this works.

## Day 9: Sunday, February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went through the JavaScript Udemy class and did an overview of a variety of things such as if && comparisons, switches, object literals, and date.

**Thoughts** It felt nice to go through the Udemy course and do an refresher of things I had learned earlier in my Geekwise Intro to JavaScript class. I feel as though I'd been spending quite a bit of time working on projects so it was nice to to follow along to a tutorial for a day.

# Day 10: Monday, February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went through another hour of the Javascript Udemy class. Learned about functions, loops, and window object. I also read an article that highly recommended a book, The Pragmatic Programmer that I am thinking of purchasing.

**Thoughts** It was nice to do an overview of of what was presented in the Udemy class today because I felt like I hadn't fully grasped the idea of functions but they seemed easier than I thought. I think the only trouble I have is knowing when to use all of the items I've learned and how that shapes into project. Luckily, the Udemy course has a few projects in the course so I'm hoping I can continue learning with that. I also finished Section 2 and Section 3 will go more in to the DOM which has also been something I need more in-depth learning with. I also read an article that recommended The Pragmatic Programmer and am thinking of purchasing it or seeing if I can get a copy from someone.

# Day 11: Tuesday, February 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began first day in the JS no-instructor course, was paired with a team, and developed our project idea and wireframe.

**Thoughts** Today was exciting and I'm very happy with the team I have. We accomplished a lot in our first meetup together but it definitely left me very nervous in my ability to complete the project with my current skills. I would say that I may be having my first experience with imposter syndrome; my team-mates have completed this team project before and while I'm excited to work with them and am confident in their skills, I feel like I have none and am so nervous to not let them down. I am afraid I will not get my project to work and my part will be the only one lack luster. But it has pushed me to continue learning.

# Day 12: Wednesday, February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Our team agreed to create a homepage and module as practice for our project. I created one but don't believe I did well. I worked writing out or SOW.

**Thoughts** I think I let the nerves get the best of me the night prior because I spent the entire day very tired and my heartbeat was pounding all day. I tried to create the homepage and module we agreed we would all do for practice but I felt like it was a lot of work to get done in a few hours for me. I tried my best but I think I got too nervous to do my best.

# Day 13: Thursday, February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Met up with my teammates and we went into more detail about our SOW. Assigned the games we were going to be creating (I have the reading/Picture Match game) and have also agreed to pick a color theme and do the vocals for the instructions.

**Thoughts**: Their homepage's were so much better than mine, I felt too embarrassed to show mine. However, I did spend quite a bit of time working on the SOW so at least I was able to share that. One of my teammates created our slack channel and repo and we got our projects started. At the end, we stated what we would be working on for the weekened. We all agreed we would be doing a lot of research for the JS for our games.

# Day 14: Saturday, March 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent all day going through the JavaScript intro course through Udemy to refresh myself on the basics and learn more about them. I spent my time learning about the DOM, adding, deleting, creating, events. How to use functions. Traversing the dom. Bubbling events. A lot of new things learned.

**Thoughts** I spent nearly all day learning about JS. I learned a lot and the course is helpful. I am looking forward to the project that is included in the course that I will get to tomorrow.

# Day 15: Sunday, March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began a to do list through the Udemy class, began watching a 3hr video about the logic and fundamentals of JS.

**Thoughts**: I spent a few hours going through the Udemy course with the project that was creating a to do list. I do find it interested, but while I was learning, I felt as though I was just copying the work he was showing and he wasn't really explaining his thinking process or why he decides to do things the way he does. After a couple of videos, I gave up because I was reading the comments and saw a few other people feeling the same way. One person provided some resources of videos he says where people explain the logic process of JS and I began watching one video. I became really interested in one he posted that I had watched. I got through 1hr of it but got busy with laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc. Tomorrow, I will most likely be having my first meeting for my first side gig job if they are available tomorrow. I will spend the rest of the time researching work for my JS no-instructor class. 
I have to say that after this weekend of instensly studying JS, while I still feel like I have so much to learn, I am excited but so nervous. I do not want to let my team down. But I feel a bit more comfortable with JS than I did last Friday which is an accomplishment for me, for now.
I also have to say, I hate that I did not write in this log all week even though I had time. I do feel good about having had kept up with practicing code everyday, but I need to remember to log it in here.

# Day 16: Monday, March 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created basic html/css for JS no-instructor project and wrote out my thought process for the JS portion. Worked a bit on newportfolio repo and watched a couple of videos on predictions for developers for 2019 and pro tips on how to use VS Code.

**Thoughts**: I don't know if I necessarily felt burnt out with spending all weekend on JS but after creating the html/css and writing out my thought process for the JS portion, I felt the need to work on something else. I still feel okay and I feel I retained as much as I could of what I learned over the weekend becauase it was a lot of information but I know I can do it, maybe I just needed a break. I spent some time working on my newportfolio repo and came up with the wireframe for it and began creating it but then through finding some music, came across some interesting videos related to VS Code and developer trends for 2019. I also watched some of the 3hr video of the fundamentals of JS that I haven't finished but it was only like 10 mins that I watched.

# Day 17: Tuesday, March 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Javascript for my page.

**Thoughts** I wasn't able to get the Javascript to work for my page, but I researched and tried different methods. I think I have it, but I need to change something in order to get it to work. So far, I can get the entire background of the page to change, I just need to direct it so that the border of the divs can change. I could try making the divs a button, but I know you can do it to just a div. I'll have to try out that method soon.

# Day 18: Thursday, March 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript for my page. WAS ABLE TO GET JS TO WORK.

**Thoughts** We had our Js no-instructor get together today and I let my teammates know that I was having trouble changing the bordrer. One of my teammates found some resources for me that I hadn't yet seen and luckily, found a solution for me. Unfortunately, it looked like it only worked on one border, but not the rest; however, I'm happy that he was willing to help me and it did start pointing me towards a better direction.

# Day 19: Saturday, March 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Attended the Women's International Day Conference and learned about machine learning and a class on soddering my own earrings.

**Thoughts** This day was so fun! I still want to count this as a day of coding as I did attend a workshop on Machine Learning that was super interesting but I also believe coding is not always necessarily straight coding; sometimes it's about connecting with others in the field and community. I felt so validated in being a woman brand new to the tech industry and I'm looking forward to my progress and having many women to look up to who have gone to create amazing things.

# Day 20: Sunday, March 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Figured it out how to make all borders with changing colors! Next step is to do have it done in pairs but I'm also looking at toggling to have the colors change. We will see.

**Thoughts** I spent a few hours late at night and that seems to be when I am at my best of working on my project, haha. I stayed up until midnight researching and lots of trial and error. I loved doing it and just focusing on one thing and accomplishing it. I was not even tired the next the day (I am writing this Monday night). Hopefully I can spend some time doing the same Monday night again! But fall asleep earlier so I'm not tired for Tuesday's group.

# Day 21: Monday, March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Researched more videos on toggle classes. I believe I need an if statement.

**Thoughts**: I looked more into the toggle classes and researched some videos, including the one in the link. One of the videos said I need an if statement and I did try but my first try didn't work but I'm sure I can get it in a few more tries. If I can get the toggle to work, then I can add animation features to it and it'll look more presentable.

**Link to Work** [youtubevideo: toggle class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=degwrcZeGF0) 

# Day 22: Tuesday, March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Researched on toggle classes. Working on color wheel.

**Thoughts** I worked for a bit on toggle classes and wanted to watch some videos but didn't want to disturb others so I focused on CSS. I also realized halfway into trying to do a toggle class, that I was using the wrong css file. Luckily, I only added one class so I just ended up deleting it and adding it to the correct file. I did find a color wheel that worked for me and there isn't much difference; just the colors are a bit nicer and we have the # type of colors and not just "green". 

# Day 23: Wednesday, March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Researched on if statements. Tried some out. Is not work. Still thinking about what I need!

**Thoughts** We're halfway through and I still feel like I'm going back to step one. I know I'm truly not, because all my work keeps leading me in the right direction, but just when I thought I realized one way might work and it does, I think I should be doing it a different way. I know I can receive help but I'm not sure how direct they can be with me in telling me what may work. Sometimes I just say out loud what I'm trying to do because I think that helps me articulate what I'm looking to do. I spent some time trying to get the addeventlistener to work but it's worth it because I know I'll definitely need to use that for my project, so that is not time lost. I now know how to do an addeventlistener. I also know I will need an if statement and I am working on it but I think I will need the || else for my project too. So if they click on on set of classes || this set of classes, then this.addeventlistener.style.removeclass, && this.addeventlistener.style.addclass (pair1). MAYBE I'LL NEED TO USE A WHILE TO DO PAIRS, I'M NOT SURE. so, while pair1 is active, pair2 will be the same. I think it would be if statement and loop so that it understands that I will have two classes, paired with the other class, and that those will become paired up with a class. I feel like this has taken me forever to get to where I am but I am glad for all the time I've spent because it's gotten me to where I am right now, which is clearer than it was last week or even yesterday. I'm going to be going to the study groups for sure at least once a week from now. Perhaps Sunday, as it seems quieter and less people tend to go. I know I'll go this Friday but we'll see.

# Day 24: Thursday, March 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Went over project with Yessenia and figured out my plan.

**Thoughts**: Yessenia came over today to look at how we were doing with our projects. She said they were coming along good and I talked to her about what I've been doing with mine and I spoke to her in detail about what I wanted to do for my game and if I was going in the right direction. She said I definitely was in a good path that I would be using for, else declaration and that that seemed like a good route to go with. She said she could send me additional resources about it and looked happy at that I was figuring it out. It definitely made me feel better and not as anxious. I am looking forward to the weekend to getting a lot of work done.

# Day 25: Monday, March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Light studying on for, else loops and trying them out on my project.

**Thoughts** I HATED this past weekend. I got sick halfway through Friday and had to take a half day, as I began having a fever right before I was about to take my lunch. I spent all Saturday in bed, trying to sleep as much as I could. I couldn't do any light tasks on Sunday without feeling sweaty and exhausted after a few minutes. I had my projet in the back of my mind all weekend but a bigger voice in my head (and my friends) told me to relax and get better so I listened to it. I only feel slightly better so I decided to do some work tonight, despite having a big headache. I did some light studying on classList vs className, for/else statements, and tried some out to see if they'd work but to no avail. I'll definitely want to come to my group meet up tomorrow, hopefully not as sick. I would hate to get them sick.

# Day 26: Saturday, July 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Women's Tech project have completed making website look cohesive and adding "Add to Watchlist" button

**Thoughts**: Wow, it's been so long since I have entered in here. I bet by now I would have completed the 100 days challenge and even though I haven't posted on here in months, I have definitely been working on things and completed lots of goals. Every weekend, I tell myself I'm going to pick back up on posting here and I've finally done it now. Coincidentally, this is also the last weekend before I present on Thursday with my team for the Women Who Code Showcase. I'm nervous but excited. My team and I have defiintely put lots of work into this project and I'm excited to finally present it. I'm happy to show it off but the part about presenting to Bitwise and potential employers make me nervous and want to get it over with. But once this no-instructor is over, I have no future class to attend which is going to be very weird. I do have plans to create a project right now and was also invited to join in on another project so I will see what follows in the future.
For now, in my current project, pretty much everything is being finished up. We're currently rushing to see what other dynamic features we can add to the website. My teammates have been studying up on adding Firebase to our website and I've been making sure our pages are cohesive and have added buttons to save items to a Watch List. I also researched a table to sort through items, at least by alphabetical order and hopefully I'm able to have something full and up-and-running tomorrow. I currently have the JS to get the button toggle "save to watchlist" and "saved" but for some reason, it's only working on the first button of the card and not the rest. I'll work on that tomorrow and hopefully I can figure it out to have it start saving the items to localstorage (or firebase, if that's the way we want to go).

# Day 27: Sunday, July 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Women's Tech project: Have created a Healthy Recipes page and created presentation. Updated events on events page.

**Thoughts**: I may be quickly typing but I am brain dead from today so my spelling may not be entirely correct. I started off today with updated some of the events on our events page because I noticed some had passed already (I also found a free yoga class near me!). Then I received a notice that my teammate was going to complete one of my tasks so I let her know she's welcome to message me if she needs help. With some free time, I asked if they'd like to encompass a more "healthy lifestyles" website by adding a healthy recipes page. They said yes, I worked on that. Just need to find where they got our icons for for our nav and home page so I can find an icon of an apple to encompass our healthy recipes page, but that can be done tomorrow. I also created a powerpoint presentation with talking points. It includes why we chose our project and what featurs we have and what we hoep to accomplish with it. With that said, I'm tired! Hopefully my teammate got everything working but I did message her again later in the day for a follow up and reminder I can help but it seems likes good news seeing that she hasn't responded. Hopefully I can help tomorrow if any last minute things need changing. Good night.

# Day 28: Monday, July 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 25 minutes on FreeCodeCamp, Played with CSS Animations, Read about API's

**Thoughts**: It's been awhile since I've practiced or played around with code. I think my mind needed a bit of a mental break from always being in a Geekwise class and kind of feeling burnt out. But after a couple weeks, I feel great and am ready to learn more. I technically didn't stop; I was reading and going through FreeCodeCamp but just leisurely. Today, I finished a portion of the HTML/CSS FreeCodeCamp on Animations nad design. I learned about some fun animation tricks and created a small repo to practice them on. It was a lot of fun creating bouncing items and watching them move on the screen. I am already thinking of what I can incorporate to bounce on my portfolio to add some pizaz. I read an article about API's and learned about browser API's and third-party API's. After reading it, it made so much more sense. That's it for tonight. Hopefully I come back to this tomorrow. I kind of want to host my bouncy ball repo and just post it on social media for fun.

# Day 29: Tuesday, July 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 45 minutes on FreeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript section, read two articles about fundamentals, surfed on Mozilla

**Thoughts**: I really felt I needed to get back into JavaScript. I never went far into FreeCodeCamp's section about JavaScript so I started doing some tutorials thinking I wouldn't spend more than 15 minutes but I got carried away and spent almost an hour. It started when I read an article earlier today about learning fundamentals vs heuristics and read another article about how to focus on learning using a fundamental approach. I do sometimes think that when I'm in a project where I have yet to create something without the guidance of a more experienced learner, I go to a heuristics approach and the article is right; it hardly works. So I'm going to try to work on really keeping in mind about the fundamentals and when I come across something new for me, to focus on what I am needing and how to ask the right questions. With that, I surfed through Mozilla and their JavaScript documentation for about 15 minutes before going over to FreeCodeCamp. I created a small repo too so that I can quickly practice agian what I just went through just to make sure I remember. Event though I've worked with JavaScript so much, it does feel easy to forget the simple stuff.

# Day 30: Wednesday, July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 15 minutes on FreeCodeCamp, 30 minutes reading articles about what to watch out for when creating HTML document, 25 minutes creating mad libs repo

**Thoughts**: I read a few articles on Medium again about HTML and what to watch out (missing end bracket, missing "", simple mistakes), and then I found a cool article with lots of resrouces on practicing for interiews as a software engineer. I found it quite intimidating considering I never got a degree in computer science, so I know nothing yet about algorithms, SQL, etc. But it made me feel better that the author wrote that it's okay if we didn't yet know how to solve the problems presented because that's what practice is for. I then went to FreeCodeCamp and worked a bit on concatenating sentences. It made me think of mad libs so I wanted to create a short mad libs project. I quickly started a repo before realizing I would want to create a text field, a button, a way for the noun to show in the predetermined text, etc. So I just created the text field and button.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on MadLibs Game repo for 30 minutes, job searched for 30 mins, freecodecamp Javascript basics for 15 minutes

**Thoughts**: I worked on my MadLibs Game repo for about 30 minutes, and I accomplished the next goal I had set for it. My goal was to be able to save the value of the noun to localstorage. I also made a container-fluid just to make everything centered but then I got stuck on that because my header was made on HTML but my other elements were created through JS so I need to see how to make it all centered. I was honestly just surprised and happy at how much I remembered of JS when it came to saving an item to localstorage. It worked on the second try! I also job searched and found 1 job in Clovis that is actually looking for someone who has the skills I have. I mean, they are looking for 2+ years experience and I only have 1 but I think it would still be good to apply just for the resume practice. The company looks very sucessful; they have lots of well-known clients. I haven't applied yet but maybe tomorrow or Wednesday. Then I went onto freecodecamp for a little bit and worked a bit on arrays (how to grab a value of an array, how multi dimensional arrays look)

**Today's Progress**: Watched 1hr video about Node.js

**Thoughts**: I decided to watch a long video about Node.js. I'm still not finished with it yet but I'm almost there. I spent a little longer taking notes down and rewatching certain parts where I felt I zoned out a little. It was very interesting though. It was nice to learn that it's pretty much just JavaScript so there's no need to learn a new language. But there are fundamentals and concepts that are new to me. I did learn that node does not have a window or any documents objects. The video also told me about a cool toool called JSHint that can show you errors and what they may be. Tomorrow I want to create my cover letter for the job application. I'm pretty sure I won't get a call back or anything, but it's still exciting to be somewhat qualified for this job. It's with a very cool company so I'm just happy to apply.

#Day 33: Thursday, August 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished video about Node.jS, watched second video about why to use Node.js

**Thoughts**: I finished the node.js video and it was pretty cool to see that i can access info about my operating system and create a web server. I can definitely see by the documentation on the node.js website that there's a lot to this but i know it's just one step at a time. I then rewatched the beginning because I needed to hear again what Node.js is and how it works and what to use it for. I forgot that node.js is actually not a programming language or a framework. It's a runtime environment for JS code. Then I watched another video where I learned that Node.js is good because it's asynchronous, meaning it can handle various requests at a time. Also that many popular websites use it. And because you use JS, you don't need to learn a new programming language. You can use JS for front end and back end. I didn't end up writing the cover letter because it has been awhile since I've written one, let alone one for a new career field. I wanted to do some more research but as I said, I doubt I'll be asked to interview or be considered seeing that I don't have the required years they're looking for but I just want to apply for the resume/cover letter practice. I'm going to be researching over the weekend. I forgot to add that when I saw the listing on Tuesday, I did see that they had only opened it on Monday so it hasn't even been a week yet so I still have time.

#Day 34: Saturday, August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed two sections of FreeCodeCamp, added group projects to portfolio, added a keyframe for design, added social media

**Thoughts**: I completed two sections of FreeCodeCamp. I completed the HTML/CSS part that had to do with accessability and media queries. Then I finally tackled something I've been meaning to do, which is add my group projects to my portfolio. I added the one I did for the first no-instructor and then the one with the women's cohort. Then I also added a keyframe that moved the "hello" up and down slightly however it moves all the other text under it. I tried many different ways and tested by having the text change color instead of movemnet but I'm guessing the items below it move because their position needs to be fixed. I did try that but I'll have to go back and explore that more because I just got tired. I ended up movin to social media because I remembered I had it on there but I needed to update the fontawesome on it. I got it pretty quickly and styled it. I think I spent pretty much from 3pm - 11pm working on stuff (with breaks in between). Now to sleep. Hopefully tomorrow I can work on the madlibs game. I'd also like to try some more stuff on node.js to get more acquainted with it. 

#Day 35: Sunday, August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed reading the sample for The Pragmmatic Programmer. Completed the tutorials for Responsive Web Design Cerification on FreeCodeCamp (just need to do projects).

**Thoughts**: Finally completed all the tutorial sections for the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. I already started the Tribute project that's part of it. They have you do like, 5 projects that are supposed to go over everything that was taught in the tutorials. I also finished the samp;le for The Pragmmatic Prorammer. Tomorrow I'm going to at least complete the tribute page but hopefully I can start on the next project too. Seeing that I'm almost done with the section and can put this on my resume, I kind of want to make sure I finish it.
